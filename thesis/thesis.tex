\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}
\todo[inline]{Begriffserklärung: renewable energy (wind, solar, bla)}
This chapter provides the necessary background knowledge to comprehend our approach to the presented problem. First, we introduce the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning (RL), often modeled as finite Markov decision processes (MDP). However, considering the limitations of this traditional framework in handling continuous state and action spaces, we also delve into the soft actor-critic method as a promising solution.

\section{CityLearn Framework}
\subsection{Presentation}
The CityLearn framework \cite{vazquez2020citylearn} aims to provide a standardized environment for multi-agent RL applications in the demand-side energy management. For this, hourly input datasets of building energy consumptions, weather and weather forecasts, and optional solar generation of buildings should be provided. The framework passes these information as state values to the agents (see Chapter \ref{sec:reinforcement-learning}) and calculates a number of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on the actions taken by the agents. The framework assumes that defined indoor temperatures of the buildings always have to be met. Thus, if the action of the agents do not reach this goal, the actions would be overwritten. Thereby, the framework provides flexibility for different goals: Individual reward functions can be defined, own data can be used and also own agents can be defined. These agents can either be multi-agent, so each building is defined as one agent, or central-agent, where all buildings are controlled by a single agent. The building data defines the electricity needed for non-shiftable devices, water heating, and space cooling and heating at each time step. Via storage devices for electricity, heating, or cooling, the buildings can load und unload these in their actions and thus optimize their energy consumption. Addtionally, each building can have a photovoltaic (PV) as additional energy source to the energy provided by the grid. If more energy is produced by the PV then used from the building, the overflow is wasted: No energy sharing between buildings is possible. 

Detailed information about the pre-defined state and action variables are described in Appendix \ref{tab:citylearn-states}. \todo[inline]{KPIs implemented and used in appendix (oder halt hier, kp)}

\subsection{Adaptions}
Since our goal was to maximize the use of renewable energy and this was not possible with the current state of the CityLearn framework, we had to introduce some adaptions regarding the state space of the environment and the KPIs.

First of all, we added the hourly fuel mix of the energy provided by the grid as input data. This includes the produced renewable energy in kilowatt hour (kWh) $E_{renewable}^t$ at time step $t$ and the share of available renewable energy of the total produced amount of energy. However, the former may not be in an appropriate scale for the energy consumed by the buildings in the simulations. Hence, the median electricity consumption per hour $\bar{E}_b$ in kWh is expected as input for each building $b \in B$. Then, the absolute produced renewable energy of the grid is calculated as 
\begin{equation}
	\hat{E}_{renewable}^t = E_{renewable}^t \cdot \sum_{b\in B} \bar{E}_b,
\end{equation}
and thus scaled to an value that, in the median, meets the energy consumption of the buildings. \todo[inline]{Lower?} If more energy from the grid is used than renewable calculated, we assume that this energy is produced by fossil sources.

Next, since a large part of the renewable energy is wind energy, \todo[inline]{source or reference to introduction} we added the current wind speed in $m/s$ as well as the forecasts with a forecast horizon of 6h, 12h and 24h accordingly to the other weather data to the environment state. 


\section{Datasets}
\subsection{Building data}
\label{sec:building-data}
As building data, we used the one provided by CityLearn for the CityLearn Challenge 2021. These datasets contain the battery and PV specifications for 13 buildings. Each of them has a battery with attributes as specified in Table \ref{tab:battery-attributes} and a PV with a nominal power of 5 \textcolor{red}{kW} for building 4 and buildings 10-17. All other buildings have a PV with nominal power 4.

Moreover, for each building, the equioment electric power and the solar generation time series per hour is provided. The input variables are described in Appendix \ref{tab:buildings-vars}. Since we used different weather data than the one in the challenge, we also resimulated the solar generation time series of the buildings. For this, we used the python library pvlib \textcolor{red}{TODO source} and followed there simulation instructions on their website\footnote{See \url{https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/adr-pvarray/plot_simulate_fast.html}}. For the weather data, we used the one described in Chapter \ref{sec:weather-data}. As location, we used \textcolor{red}{TODO}. Finally, for \textcolor{red}{TODO P\_STC} we used the maximum solar generation of the original data and added 500 W in order to meet approximately the same mean generation of all buildings as in the original dataset.

To obtain the median values for the energy consumption per hour with storage and PV, without storage, and without storage and PV, we trained the \textcolor{red}{SAC} agent with hyperparameter values \textcolor{red}{bliblablu} \textcolor{red}{n} episodes on \textcolor{red}{the data} and calculated the median of these values. The obtained medians are given in Appendix \ref{tab:building-medians}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lXc}
Attribute name & Description & Value \\ \hline
Capacity & Maximum amount of energy the storage device can store & 6.4 kWh \\
Efficiency & Technical efficiency & 90 \% \\
Capacity loss coefficient & Storage capacity lost in each charge and discharge cycle (as a fraction of the total capacity) & $1e^{-5}$ \\
Loss coefficient & Standby hourly losses & 0 \\
Nominal power & Maximum amount of electric power that the battery can use to charge or discharge & 5 \textcolor{red}{kW}
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Attributes of the batteries of each building. Description of the attributes obtained from \textcolor{red}{TODO source}}
\label{tab:battery-attributes}
\end{table}

\subsection{Fuelmix and Weather data}
\label{sec:weather-data}
The fuel mix data we used is obtained from the \textcolor{red}{NY-ISO}, retrieved on the 7th of June 2023. The original data provides the produced energy in MW for each of the energy sources dual fuel, natural gas, nuclear, \textcolor{red}{other fossil fuels}, wind, hydro, and \textcolor{red}{other renewables} for a time interval of 5 minutes for 2021. Since we are only interested in renewable (wind, hydro, other renewables) or non-renewable (all others) energy produced, we summed these values up and calculated the value in kWh. \todo[inline]{kW vs MW vs kWh????} To meed the hourly time steps of the building data, we calculated the hourly mean of the values, because \textcolor{red}{???}. The final fuelmix data contains the hourly amount of energy produced with renewable sources in kWh and the share of renewable energy produced calculated as the absolute amount of renewable energy produced devided by the total produced energy.. Note, that this data does not include the solar generation of the buildings described in Chapter \ref{sec:building-data}, but only the renewable energy from the grid.
