\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}
This chapter provides the necessary background knowledge to comprehend our approach to the presented problem. First, we introduce the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning (RL), often modeled as finite Markov decision processes (MDP). However, considering the limitations of this traditional framework in handling continuous state and action spaces, we also delve into the soft actor-critic method as a promising solution.

\section{Reinforcement Learning}
As defined by Sutton and Barto \cite{sutton2018reinforcement}, RL is a machine learning method that aims to choose actions to maximize a numerical reward. RL agents learn these actions through a trial-and-error approach based on the received rewards. Also, actions may, besides the immediate reward, influence the long-term reward. In contrast to supervised methods, it does not need labeled data for learning and does not try to discover inherent structure in data as unsupervised methods.

\begin{figure}[htb]
     \center
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/rl_overview.pdf}
  \caption{In RL, the agent observes the state of the environment $s_t$ at timestep $t$ via the observation $o_t$. The policy $\pi$ determines the agent's action $a_t$, which in turn determines the next state $s_{t+1}$ of the environment and the environment sends an reward $r_t$ to the agent. The policy of the agent is trained using the observation, the action, and the reward,}
  \label{fig:rl_overview}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:rl_overview} shows the general RL approach. RL problems are often formulated as finite MDPs, where the RL agents interact with an environment. At each time step $t$, the environment is in a state $s_t$ that the agent observes. Based on this observation, the agent takes action $a_t$, which determines the next state $s_{t+1}$ of the environment. The policy $\pi=p(a_t|s_t)$ determines the action, which may also be deterministic. Also, reacting to the received action, the environment sends the agent a reward signal $r_t$. The agent's policy is trained to maximize the discounted total reward.
