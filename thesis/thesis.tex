\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}
\todo[inline]{Begriffserklärung: renewable energy (wind, solar, bla)}
This chapter provides the necessary background knowledge to comprehend our approach to the presented problem. First, we introduce the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning (RL), often modeled as finite Markov decision processes (MDP). However, considering the limitations of this traditional framework in handling continuous state and action spaces, we also delve into the soft actor-critic method as a promising solution.
