\chapter{Discussion and Outlook}
  \label{Discussion}
  
 Experiments mostly only one time --> more robust results if more often and than e.g. mean 
\section{Social Agent I}
Operates on policy update --> increasing value decreases the loss (not wanted), but increasing the probability more shifts the action to even more randomness. Also not exactly what we aimed. 

Shifted buildings --> battery capacity not changed

pearson  correlation only linear
\todo[inline]{demonstrator policy update could be tried to improve more, e.g. second autotuned learning rate, other imitation learning rates, etc.}

\todo[inline]{TODO, Outlook can become an extra chapter.}

\section{Outlook}

\subsection{Value Shaping}

\subsection{Cluster Buildings}
Cluster by e.g. energy consumption or size of battery compared to consumption or PV etc etc and then use demonstrator per cluster
